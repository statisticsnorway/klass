# KLASS
Spring Boot applications that handles classifications for SSB.
Klass provides a REST api that clients can use to read classifications, and a Vaadin frontend for maintaining classifications.

## Overview
Klass consists of 4 maven modules
 - Klass API (Standalone application that provides the Klass API)
 - Klass Forvaltning (Frontend for classification maintaining)
 - Klass Shared (Classes shared between API and Forvaltning. primary database and search components)
 - Klass Solr (Solr Core configuration  and configuration for embedded solr for test/development)


### Build and Deploy

Building the project will output  war files for **Klass API** & **Klass Forvaltning** and a zip file (WiP) for **Klass Solr**.

You can find these in each maven modules target folder.
```
klass-api/target/klass-api-{Version}.war
klass-forvaltning/target/klass-forvaltning-{Version}.war
klass-solr/klass-solr-{Version}.zip (WiP)
```

#### Server configuration

Klass was made with Tomcat in mind and configuration on servers are done in `tomcat.conf` (usually found in ~tomcat/conf)
variables in `application properties` will be overridden/replaced with properties found in `tomcat.conf`
ex. the value for `klass.env.mariadb.password` will be  replaced with the value from `KLASS_ENV_MARIADB_PASSWORD`.

please note that `.` is replaced with `_` in the tomcat config.

A typical `tomcat.conf` would contain the following
```
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=mariadb
KLASS_ENV_MARIADB_INSTANCE=mysql-server
KLASS_ENV_MARIADB_PASSWORD=Password
KLASS_ENV_LOGGING_PATH=/var/log/tomcat
```

### Database
Klass is configured to use Flyway for database initialising and  migration.
You can find the collection of SQL scripts in the Klass-shared module under `src/main/resources/db/migration` 

If the classification tables are empty Klass will by default attempt to import data from its predecessor. 
This process can take quite some time as there is a lot of data and its also sent to Solr to populate the search index.

Tips: If you are only setting up Klass for testing/development purposes you can use the `small-import` spring profile to reduce the amount of data being imported.

### Development
its recommended to build with maven before starting development as some classes are generated as part of the build process. 

    mvn clean install


#### Spring profiles
Klass API and Klass Forvaltning utilize Spring boot and heavily rely on Spring Profiles to make development and debugging easier. 
below is a quick summary of the profiles available (see _application.properties_ for more details) 
```
# Application profiles:
#----------------------
# Profiles for production
#   production          = no test beans and only Active Directory login
#   mariadb             = use remote mariaDB database
#   remote-solr         = use remote Solr server 
#
# Profiles for development
#   ad-offline          = will only use test/embeded AD (apacheDS) [Forvaltning only]
#   small-import        = imports a small number of classifications from legacy system, useful during development
#   mock-mailserver     = outgoing emails are only logged
#   h2                  = use h2 database (stored on your filesystem)   
#   h2-inmemory         = use h2 database but keep everything in memory only.
#   embedded-solr       = run an instance of solr as part of the application (no need to run a separate solr application)
```

#### Build profiles
we have created custom profiles for time consuming tests that can be toggled on and off to help speed up compile time during development. 
The profile named `documentation` will generate API documentation with AsciiDoc (default: enabled)
We also have a custom profile (`testbench`) for running GUI tests using TestBench (Vaadin licensed product).
There's also a `checkstyle` and a `findbugs` for use with Jenkins to create code quality reports.
    

    
### Run / Debug
You can start an application using maven with the following command 

    mvn spring-boot:run
    
Or from your IDE using the `KlassApiApplication` / `KlassForvaltningApplication` classes.
IntelliJ is recommended, it makes it very easy to start spring boot applications and will make sure your run/debug configuration has all the necessary dependencies (will include maven dependencies with provided scope).

## Troubleshooting

### Known issues

#### build fails due to encoding issues(æøå)
Windows defaults to ascii and java/maven/surefire? does for some reason use this even though utf-8 has been specified everywhere.
The current solution to this problem is to add an environment variable `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` with value `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` to your system.

#### Application running in intelliJ wont show monitor page or CSS
_Intellij 2019.1_ and earlier does not seem to detect the correct work directory and files placed in  the webapp directory might not be available to the application.
the solution is to set workdir manually in your run configuration (set it to `$MODULE_WORKING_DIR$`)
