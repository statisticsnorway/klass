== Overview
=== REST Client
Examples in this documentation use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL[curl]. The `-i` parameter in the examples includes the HTTP response headers. Be aware that when running Curl on MS Windows all single ' have to be replaced by double ". If Curl is not installed, an alternative is
to use any REST client to explore Klass Rest interface, like https://www.getpostman.com/product/api-client[Postman] or address line in browser.

=== URL Encoding
This API requires you to use Percent-encoding for symbols and characters that are not part of the standard unreserved URI characters.

For more information on Percent-encoding see this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[wikipedia article]

You can also see it in use in the request example for <<presentationNamePattern, presentationNamePattern>>


=== HTTP status codes
Klass tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was badly formed, i.e. the client has used an invalid request. The response will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist. The response will include an error providing further information
|===

=== Errors
Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the response will contain an error message
that describes the problem. For example, a request for a non-existent classification
include::{snippets}/error-example/curl-request.adoc[]

will produce a `404 Not Found` response:

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]


=== Character sets
Charset for the formats XML and JSON are UTF-8. Default charset for CSV is ISO 8859-1. This can be changed in Accept header to UTF-8.

=== Output formats
Default output format is XML. In many cases it is possible to get output in the supported output formats without using Curl `-H` (`--header`). Add the dot-prefix `.json`, `.csv` or `.xml` in the URL before the request parameters.
e.g. json: http://data.ssb.no/api/klass/v1/classifications/104/codesAt.json?date=2020-01-01[http://data.ssb.no/api/klass/v1/classifications/104/codesAt.json?date=2020-01-01]

=== Other
In PxWebApi references to a classification in Klass has the form [.small]#urn:ssb:classification:klass:ID#. This can be rewritten to [.underline]#httр://data.ssb.no/api/klass/v1/classifications/ID#.

===== Request parameters
none



== Request parameters
[[range]]
=== range
A range is a time period with a `from` date and a `to` date. The dates are specified in format `<yyyy-MM-dd>`.
`from` is inclusive and `to` is exclusive. `to` is optional, and if not specified the end of the range is considered to be indefinite.

When retrieving codes with a range the code may change during the range. This is indicated in the result with `validFrom` and `validTo`.

===== Example
A classification whose codes were updated 2014-01-01. If asking for codes for year 2013, then `validFrom/validTo` in response will be equal to `from/to` in request
include::{snippets}/range-example/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/range-example/http-response.adoc[]

If now increasing the range to also include 2014, it is seen that some codes are not valid within the whole range. Some codes end at 2014 and some codes start in 2014.
include::{snippets}/range-extended-example/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/range-extended-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[changedSince]]
=== changedSince
`changedSince` is used to find classifications that have been updated since a specified time.
`changedSince` is specified in ISO 8601 DateTime format `<yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ>` e.g. "2015-10-31T01:30:00.000-0200"

===== Example
include::{snippets}/changed-since-example/curl-request.adoc[]

[[selectCodes]]
=== selectCodes
`selectCodes` is used to limit the result to codes that match the pattern given by selectCodes. +
`selectCodes` is a comma separated list of codes (may also use wildcard ' * ') +
`selectCodes` can also contain ranges of codes, a range is defined using '-' between 2 codes (Wildcard '*' can also be used in range).

|===
| |Codes selected
| selectCodes = 3004| Only 3004
| selectCodes = 3004, 3006 | Only 3004 and 3006
| selectCodes = 3004, 11* | 3004 and all starting with 11
| selectCodes = 3004-3400 | range from 3004 to 3400
| selectCodes = 3004-34* | range from 3004 to any higher code starting with 34

include::{snippets}/select-level-example/curl-request.adoc[]
===== Example response
include::{snippets}/select-level-example/http-response.adoc[]


[[presentationNamePattern]]
=== presentationNamePattern
`presentationNamePattern` is used to build an alternative presentationName.
To build a presentationName use curly braces to access other columns:

{code} +
{name} +
{shortName} +
{lowercase(code/name/shortname)} +
{uppercase(code/name/shortname)} +
{capitalize(code/name/shortname)}

===== Examples

|0101 - Halden

|{code} - {lowercase(name)}
|0101 - halden

|{code} - {capitalize(name)}
