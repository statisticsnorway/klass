== Overview
=== Rest Client
Examples in this documentation use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL[curl]. If this tool is unknown an alternative is
to use a Rest client to explore Klass Rest interface, see instructions link:rest-client-guide.html[Rest client guide].

=== URL Encoding
The current version of this API requires you to use Percent-encoding for symbols and characters that are not part of the standard unreserved URI characters.

For more information on Percent-encoding see this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding[wikipedia article]

You can also see it in use in the request example for <<presentationNamePattern, presentationNamePattern>>


=== HTTP status codes
Klass tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was badly formed, i.e. the client has used an invalid request. The response will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist. The response will include an error providing further information
|===

=== Errors
Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the response will contain an error message
that describes the problem. For example, a request for a non-existent classification
include::{snippets}/error-example/http-request.adoc[]

will produce a `404 Not Found` response:

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

===== Request parameters
none


== Request parameters
[[range]]
=== range
A range is a time period with a `from` date and a `to` date. The dates are specified in format `<yyyy-MM-dd>`.
`from` is inclusive and `to` is exclusive. `to` is optional, and if not specified the end of the range is considered to be indefinite.

When retrieving codes with a range it must be understood that the code may change during the range. This is indicated in result with `validFrom` and `validTo`.

===== Example
A classification whose codes were updated 2014-01-01. If asking for codes for year 2013, then `validFrom/validTo` in response will be equal to `from/to` in request
include::{snippets}/range-example/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/range-example/http-response.adoc[]

If now increasing the range to also include 2014, it is seen that some codes are not valid within the whole range. Some codes end at 2014 and some codes start in 2014.
include::{snippets}/range-extended-example/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/range-extended-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[changedSince]]
=== changedSince
`changedSince` is used to find classifications that have been updated since a specified time.
`changedSince` is specified in ISO 8601 DateTime format `<yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ>` e.g. "2015-10-31T01:30:00.000-0200

===== Example
include::{snippets}/changed-since-example/http-request.adoc[]

[[selectCodes]]
=== selectCodes
`selectCodes` is used to limit the result to codes that match the pattern given by selectCodes. +
`selectCodes` is a comma separated list of codes (may also use wildcard ' * ') +
`selectCodes` can also contain ranges of codes, a range is defined using '-' between 2 codes (Wildcard '*' can also be used in range).

|===
| |Codes selected
| selectCodes = 0104| Only 0104
| selectCodes = 0104, 0106 | Only 0104 and 0106
| selectCodes = 0104, 02* | 0104 and all starting with 02
| selectCodes = 0104-0200 | range from 0104 to 0200
| selectCodes = 0104-02* | range from 0104 to any higher code starting with 02
|===

|===

===== Example request for language=nb
include::{snippets}/language-example/http-request.adoc[]

===== Example request for selectLevel=1
include::{snippets}/select-level-example/http-request.adoc[]
===== Example response
include::{snippets}/select-level-example/http-response.adoc[]


[[presentationNamePattern]]
=== presentationNamePattern
`presentationNamePattern` is used to build an alternative presentationName.
To build a presentationName use curly braces to access other columns:

{code} +
{name} +
{shortName} +
{lowercase(code/name/shortname)} +
{uppercase(code/name/shortname)} +
{capitalize(code/name/shortname)}

===== Examples
Given that: +
code = 0101 +
name = Halden +

|===
|presentationNamePattern |presentationName

|{code} - {name}
|0101 - Halden

|{code} - {lowercase(name)}
|0101 - halden

|{code} - {capitalize(name)}
|0101 - Halden

|{code} - {uppercase(name)}
|0101 - HALDEN

|{name} {code}
|Halden 0101

== Other
[[page]]
=== page
